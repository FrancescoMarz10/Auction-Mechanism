# Auction-Mechanism
Auction mechanism based on P2P Network. Each peer can sell and buy goods using a Second-Price Auctions (EBay). second-price auction is a non-truthful auction mechanism for multiple items. Each bidder places a bid. The highest bidder gets the first slot, the second-highest, the second slot and so on, but the highest bidder pays the price bid by the second-highest bidder, the second-highest pays the price bid by the third-highest, and so on. The systems allows the users to create new auction (with an ending time, a reserved selling price and a description), check the status of an auction, and eventually place new bid for an auction. As described in the AuctionMechanism Java API.
